		<description><br/><b>1.</b> Click on the <b>Goto Workbench</b> button. The <b>Welcome</b> screen will close and you
			will see the <b>Create Project</b> dialog box.<br/><b>2.</b> Every Debrief project requires a name, so you
			can go with the default name of <b>DebriefProject</b>, or enter something more meaningful. I
			will name mine “<b>Debrief_test_project_01</b>”.<br/><b>3.</b> You can leave the <b>Add Debrief Samples</b> and
			<b>Always Check at Startup</b> boxes checked.<br/><b>4.</b> Click on the <b>Ok</b> button. The dialog box will
			close and you will see an empty Debrief interface consisting of various items and
			objects (we will go over these in a second).<br/><b>5.</b> If you look in the <b>Navigator</b> ‘window’,
			you will see your new project name folder.
			<br/>In Debrief, this small window is called a
			<b>View</b>. There are different types of view, all of which perform different functions; e.g.,
			if you click on the <b>Time Controller</b> tab (next to <b>Navigator</b>), you&apos;ll see we have a set of
			video-type controls: very useful for displaying time elements in Debrief.
			<br/>Underneath these 2 views are 3 other views: <b>Properties</b>, <b>Track Tote</b>, and <b>Chart Overview</b>; again, each
			of these views performs a different function. We won&apos;t look at these now, but these
			views and other interface items such as toolbars, menus, and the plot editor (the large
			empty space to the right of the views) make up a large part of Debrief.
			<br/>Though empty, the interface may seem a little daunting at first, but we&apos;ll work through all of these
			items and you’&apos;ll come to realise that it&apos;s actually quite easy to work with.
